Instructions to compile and run the program

Platform used: 	C++ for the graph operations.
		MATLAB for plotting the histogram.

IDE: Visual Studio & MATLAB

Code directory contains two folders 1, C++ files and 2, MATLAB files
1, Open a new project->win32 console application
2, Delete everything already present in the source. All the headers are present in the code that was uploaded.
3, Copy and paste the entire uploaded C++ code into the source cpp file of your project.
4, Find (ctrl+f) “C:\\Sivakumar\\ASU\\SEM 1\\CEN 502\\Project\\” and replace with the path in which ‘CS310_project_subregion’ folder is present. This updates the file names used in the code. 
5, Execute the program.
6, The program outputs a txt file in the project directory. This is needed to plot the histogram.
7, Move this txt file to the ‘MATLAB files’ folder under the code directory and run the .m file to generate the histogram.
